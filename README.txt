This module contains functions for setting up and running cascades on networks, creating and manipulating adjacency matrices, and generating truth tables for Boolean functions. It also includes functions for plotting and visualizing network structures.

The module is organized into sections for different types of functions, including setup functions for different types of networks, functions for running cascades on these networks, and functions for generating and manipulating truth tables. Additionally, there are utility functions for converting between different data representations and for setting up random seeds for reproducibility.

The module makes use of several external libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Networkit, and Pynauty. Some functions are designed to work with specific types of networks, such as random geometric graphs, and others are more general-purpose and can be used with any type of network.

Please note that the module contains a mix of vectorized and non-vectorized implementations of cascade algorithms, as well as some experimental or incomplete functions. Users should exercise caution and carefully review the code before using it in a production environment.
